<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Project Overview</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">Melioraa is the flagship software solution <b>developed by XdotO Concepts Pte Limited</b>
    as part of a comprehensive <b>Industry
        4.0 Machine Monitoring System.</b> Tailored <b>primarily for apparel and garment factories,</b> this solution
    has also been
    successfully adapted for industries including <b>tea production, railway operations, power generation, and weather
        monitoring.</b></p>

<p class="scroll-animate-up">Melioraa <b>provides a web-based real-time monitoring and analytics dashboards</b> for
    industrial machines. It tracks
    critical metrics such as <b>machine state (active/idle), temperature, production rate, efficiency, accuracy, and
        more,</b>
    across a wide range of machines—from sewing, knitting, and weaving equipment to large-scale machinery in tea
    factories, power stations, and weather stations. It delivers<b> data-driven insights, predictive maintenance
        capabilities, and seamless integration with existing systems, helping businesses improve productivity and reduce
        downtime.</b></p>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Architecture</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">The system architecture is divided into two major components:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up"><b>Aurigaa (Hardware & Embedded Layer):</b> This layer is responsible for interfacing
        with physical machines
        through
        various sensors. Developed by the electrical engineering team, it utilizes <b>GO to collect real-time machine
            data
            and transmit it to the backend servers over a dedicated networking layer.</b>
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up"><b>Melioraa (Software Platform):</b> Developed by the software engineering team,
        including myself, this is the
        <b>user-facing platform that processes, analyzes, visualizes, and reports the data gathered from Aurigaa.</b> It
        is built using <b>Java with Spring Boot for the backend, MySQL as the database, Hibernate and JPA for ORM, and a frontend stack comprising
        ReactJS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Material-UI, and Bootstrap, with Axios and JSON used for data communication.</b>
        The solution follows a
        <b>microservices backend and micro-frontend architecture</b> for scalability and modularity.
    </li>
</ul>
