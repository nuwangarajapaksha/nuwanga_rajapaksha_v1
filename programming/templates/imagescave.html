<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Project Overview</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">ImagesCave is a <b>fully functional image selling web platform developed as my main
    second-year project.</b> The platform provides an integrated marketplace for <b>photographers and graphic designers
    to
    upload and sell their work, while customers can browse, purchase, and download high-quality images.</b> The solution
    is
    designed with <b>two main interfaces: a contributor-facing portal for image management and sales, and a
        customer-facing
        interface for browsing and purchasing, supported by a robust admin panel for full platform management.</b></p>

<p class="scroll-animate-up">The system supports <b>secure user authentication, streamlined image review and pricing
    workflows, automated invoicing, and detailed sales reporting.</b> Its architecture emphasizes <b>ease of use,
    transaction
    security, and scalability</b> for future enhancements.</p>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Architecture</h3>
<ul>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">The <b>backend, developed in PHP, handles all core business logic, authentication, and
        request processing, while integrating with a MySQL database to store and manage user accounts, product details,
        transactions, and system records. The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, delivers a
        responsive and user-friendly experience for buyers, contributors, and admins.</b> The platform is further
        enhanced with <b>PayHere Payment Gateway integration for secure online payments and an email notification service to
        automatically send invoices and updates to users. For deployment, the system is hosted on a shared hosting
        server with a purchased domain, managed via cPanel.</b>
