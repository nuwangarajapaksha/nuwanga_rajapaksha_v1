<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Project Overview</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">Health First is a simple yet engaging website <b>developed for a local fitness center as my
    very first university web development project.</b> The platform serves as an <b>online presence for the fitness center,
    featuring essential information such as a gallery, class schedules, upcoming events, and contact details.</b> Designed
    to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, the site enables visitors to explore the center’s offerings and stay
    informed about activities and programs.</p>

<p class="scroll-animate-up">The project was developed entirely using my basic front-end development knowledge at the
    time, focusing on clean structure, intuitive navigation, and clear presentation of content. It marked my initial
    step into practical web design and development, serving as a strong foundation for my later, more complex
    projects.</p>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Architecture</h3>
<ul>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">The website is built entirely with <b>static front-end technologies — HTML for structure,
        CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity.</b> All content is displayed directly in the pages
        without backend integration or databases, ensuring quick load times and straightforward deployment. JavaScript
        is used to enhance user experience through simple interactive elements, while CSS ensures a visually consistent
        and responsive design.
