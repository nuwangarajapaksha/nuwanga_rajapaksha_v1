<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Project Overview</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">Election Sri Lanka is a <b>fully functional Online Election Management Platform developed as a
    solo second-year university assignment.</b> The system is designed to <b>digitize and streamline the entire election
    process, from voter registration to secure voting and automatic result generation.</b></p>

<p class="scroll-animate-up">The platform enables <b>voter management, candidate management, party management, and position
    handling, ensuring a smooth and transparent election workflow.Voters can register and login using their National
    Identity
    Card (NIC) number and cast votes for their preferred parties and candidates.</b>  The system also
    features an integrated guideline page to assist users.</p>

<p class="scroll-animate-up">On the administrative side, <b>admins can register and log in to manage all aspects of the
    election, including administrators, candidates, parties, positions, voters, and results.</b> The <b>result computation
    process is automated, eliminating the possibility of human error and increasing election credibility.</b></p>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Architecture</h3>
<ul>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">The application is built using a <b>PHP backend for server-side processing, integrated
        with MySQL as the relational database to store voter records, election data, and results. The frontend leverages
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to provide a responsive, user-friendly interface.</b> The system follows a
        modular approach to separate core functionalities for voters and administrators, ensuring maintainability and
        scalability.
