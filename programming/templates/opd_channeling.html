<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Project Overview</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">OPD Channeling is a <b>fully functional E-Channeling Web Platform developed as a solo
    second-year university assignment.</b> The system is designed to <b>digitize and streamline outpatient department
    (OPD)
    appointment management by connecting patients, doctors, and hospitals in a single online platform.</b></p>

<p class="scroll-animate-up">The main focus of the application is to <b>manage e-channeling operations, including
    patient
    handling, doctor handling, and hospital handling.</b> Patients can register and book appointments with available
    doctors. Doctors can register to offer their consultation services, manage their channels, and view upcoming
    appointments. Hospitals can pre-register in the system, allowing their doctors and services to be listed.
    An integrated admin panel allows administrators to manage patients, doctors, hospitals, and all appointment-related
    operations, ensuring smooth coordination between stakeholders.</p>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Architecture</h3>
<ul>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">The application is built using a <b>PHP backend for server-side logic, combined with
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for a responsive and intuitive frontend. MySQL serves as the relational
        database,</b> storing user profiles, hospital details, appointment records, and administrative data. The
        application
        follows a modular structure to separate concerns between the core functionalities of patients, doctors,
        hospitals, and the admin panel.
