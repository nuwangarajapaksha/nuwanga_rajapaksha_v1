<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Project Overview</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">Dialog Power App is a mission-critical mobile and web-based application <b>developed by
    XdotO
    Concepts Pte Limited in collaboration with Dialog Axiata PLC,</b> Sri Lanka’s leading telecom provider. This system
    was
    designed to modernize the <b>alarm and notification management</b> process across Dialog’s extensive
    infrastructure—including signal towers, distribution centers, maintenance sites and etc.</p>

<p class="scroll-animate-up">The application enables field officers, such as site managers and regional managers, to
    <b>receive, track, and respond to various real-time alarms and notifications—including theft alerts, low battery
        warnings, and maintenance requests.</b> It improves operational responsiveness, facilitates task coordination,
    and
    generates actionable insights for management.</p>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Architecture</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">The system architecture consists of three main components:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up"><b>Mobile App:</b> Deployed to officers in the field for
        <b>real-time alarm monitoring, acknowledgment, and task processing.</b> Built with <b>Flutter</b> for cross-platform support
        and <b>Native Android</b> for optimized performance.
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up"><b>Admin Web Panel:</b> Used by administrators to <b>manage users,
        monitor site-level activities, generate reports, and review performance analytics.</b> Developed with <b>ReactJS and
        Redux, styled using HTML, CSS, Material-UI, and Bootstrap.</b>
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up"><b>Backend Platform:</b> Built using a <b>microservices
        architecture,</b> the backend handles <b>alarm processing, user and role management, workflow handling, and analytics.</b>
        Implemented with <b>Java and Spring Boot, using MySQL as the database, with JPA and Hibernate for ORM, and JSON for data communication</b> between services and the frontend.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Key Features</h3>
