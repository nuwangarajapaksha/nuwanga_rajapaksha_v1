<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Project Overview</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">ADYAPANA is a simple yet comprehensive <b>desktop application developed as part of my
    first-year university assignment. Designed for educational centers,</b> the system streamlines administrative processes
    by offering <b>centralized management of students, teachers, subjects, classes, and payments.</b> The system is designed to
    be simple, intuitive, and efficient, helping educational centers streamline their day-to-day management while
    ensuring <b>accurate record keeping and generating clear payment invoices</b> for students.</p>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Architecture</h3>
<ul>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">The User Interface Layer is built with <b>Java Swing to provide a clean, easy-to-use
        desktop experience,</b> while the Business Logic Layer, implemented in <b>Java, handles core processing, data
        management, and validation.</b> The Database Layer is powered by <b>MySQL for reliable and scalable data storage.</b> The
        Reporting Layer utilizes <b>Jasper Reports to generate well-formatted PDF documents for payment invoices.</b>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Key Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Add, edit, search, and maintain detailed student profiles</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Manage teacher information and assigned subjects/classes</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Maintain subject catalogs and related details</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Organize classes with schedules, subjects, and assigned teachers</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Record, track, and report on student payments</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Automated Jasper Reports for payment receipts</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">My Role & Contributions</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">As the sole developer of ADYAPANA, I:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Designed and implemented the full application from scratch, including user interface
        layouts.
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Created and optimized the database schema using MySQL to ensure efficient, reliable,
        and scalable data storage.
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Developed all functional modules (student, teacher, subject, class, and payment
        management) in Java and Java Swing.
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Designed and integrated Jasper Reports for professional PDF output.</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Wrote and executed JUnit test cases to validate key functions and ensure quality.</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Created a distributable .exe setup using Launch4j for seamless installation and
        execution on Windows systems.
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Delivered the project with full technical documentation.</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Applied creative thinking to design a logical, efficient workflow for managing
        educational center operations.
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Solved implementation challenges and handled unforeseen situations independently,
        ensuring timely delivery of the project.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Academic Relevance</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">ADYAPANA demonstrated my ability to develop a complete software solution independently,
    from design to deployment, during my <b>first year at university.</b> The project enhanced my skills and laid a strong
    foundation for my future work in software engineering.
