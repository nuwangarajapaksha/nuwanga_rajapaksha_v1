<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Project Overview</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">Morex is a comprehensive <b>Process Monitoring System developed by XdotO Concepts Pte
    Limited
    as a sub-project for Morex Industries.</b> Designed as a web-based application, it <b>streamlines and digitizes the
    production workflows and operational monitoring of industrial chemical and material processing.</b> The system
    enables
    users to
    manage <b>end-to-end production workflow sand sub-production workflows, inventory, error corrections, history
        tracking, alarms, reporting, real-time monitoring, and graphical visualizations through a role-based
        interface.</b></p>

<p class="scroll-animate-up">The application supports <b>five parallel production workflows, referred to as "Reactors."
    Each reactor represents a complete production line involving multiple steps—such as machine status checks, material
    and chemical addition, and data logging—with predefined templates to simplify execution.</b> Users can interact with
    each <b>workflow in real time, monitor progress, and handle deviations or alarms as needed.</b></p>

<p class="scroll-animate-up">To enhance operational visibility, the system enables <b>real-time analysis
    of
    production processes, ensuring improved efficiency, reduced downtime, and data-driven decision-making within the
    manufacturing environment.</b></p>


<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Architecture</h3>
<ul>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">The application is built on a monolithic <b>PHP backend with VueJS, JavaScript, HTML,
        CSS
        and Bootstrap for the frontend.</b>
        <b>MySQL is used as the relational database</b> to store production data, templates, inventory logs, and more.
        <b>Grafana was integrated into the system to visualize live sensor data such as machine temperature, thresholds,
            and other key metrics.</b> The entire application is <b>deployed on a Linux-based on-premise server.</b>
    </li>
</ul>
