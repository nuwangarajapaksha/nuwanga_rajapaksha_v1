<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Project Overview</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">NDCamera is a comprehensive <b>camera-selling platform developed as a final year university
    project.</b> The solution consists of two integrated components: a web-based <b>e-commerce application and a mobile
    m-commerce Android application,</b> both designed to deliver a user-friendly and feature-rich online shopping
    experience
    for camera products.</p>

<p class="scroll-animate-up">The platform includes a <b>customer-facing interface with modern shopping functionalities
    as
    well as an admin panel for complete store management.</b> The solution provides <b>real-time product search, order
    tracking, secure checkout, and personalized user experiences.</b> Both the web and mobile apps are <b>developed
    independently</b> and function as complementary systems.</p>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Architecture</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">The system is designed with two separate components:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up"><b>E-Commerce Web Application:</b>
        Built using <b>Java EE,</b> this component includes a <b>JSP/Servlet-based MVC architecture for backend
            services,</b> integrates <b>MySQL for database operations, and uses Hibernate and JPA for ORM.</b> The <b>frontend is built
            using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for responsiveness, while JSON and Axios enable efficient
            client–server communication.</b> The application also includes a <b>built-in mail sender service</b> for order confirmations and
        admin notifications, along with <b>PayHere Payment Gateway</b> integration for secure online transactions.</b>
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up"><b>M-Commerce Mobile Application:</b>
        Developed using <b>Android (Java)</b> and integrated with <b>Firebase Realtime Database.</b>
        <b>Google Authentication Service</b>s are used to enable quick and secure login functionality, and <b>PayHere
            Payment Gateway</b> is
        integrated to support secure in-app payments.
