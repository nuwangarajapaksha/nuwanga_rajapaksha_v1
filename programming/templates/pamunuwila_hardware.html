<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Project Overview</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">PAMUNUWILA HARDWARE is a comprehensive <b>desktop-based hardware shop management system
    developed for PAMUNUWILA HARDWARE (Pvt) Ltd.</b> This was <b>an individual project I undertook for my 1st-year final
    project at university.</b> The system was designed to digitize and streamline all operational activities of the hardware
    business, from <b>user and inventory management to sales, delivery, and financial reporting.</b></p>

<p class="scroll-animate-up">The solution serves as an all-in-one tool for the daily operations of the business,
    providing <b>seamless management of products, stock levels, purchases, sales, deliveries, and customer interactions,
    while maintaining a centralized, secure database.</b> It <b>replaces manual recordkeeping with a highly organized,
    automated, and scalable system.</b></p>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Architecture</h3>
<ul>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">This desktop-based application is built using <b>Java and Java Swing</b> for the frontend
        user interface, backed by <b>MySQL for structured data storage. Jasper Reports is used for generating invoices,
        bills, and all historical reports,</b> including daily, monthly, and yearly summaries.</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">The system is modularly designed, allowing each functional domain to operate
        independently yet cohesively as part of the overall system.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Key Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Login, registration, and secure user management</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Create and manage user roles and access levels</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Store and manage supplier details and associated companies</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Add and track items, real-time stock updates, low stock alerts</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Manage incoming goods and update stock accordingly</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Handle transactions, customer records, and purchase history</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Track delivery orders and manage transportation logistics</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Secure data backup and restoration for disaster recovery</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Generate and print all necessary documents using Jasper Reports</li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Access past transactions and analytics for business insights</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">My Role & Contributions</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">As the sole developer of this project, I was responsible for the entire development
    lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Conducted requirement analysis, created database schema, and defined the modular
        architecture
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Built the complete desktop UI using Java Swing, focusing on user experience and ease
        of use
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Developed all business logic, database interaction modules, and integrated MySQL for
        persistent data storage
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Created dynamic, printable invoices and reports using Jasper Reports for sales,
        inventory, deliveries, and backups
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Performed unit and integration testing across modules to ensure a bug-free and
        reliable application
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Used JUnit for unit testing and ensured robustness through extensive debugging and
        validation
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">Delivered the project with full technical documentation and deployment-ready setup
    </li>
    <li class="scroll-animate-up">utilized my leadership, critical thinking, problem-solving, and situation-handling
        skills to manage the entire development process efficiently, overcome challenges, and deliver a fully
        functional, professional-grade solution.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="scroll-animate-left">Clients & Implementation</h3>
<p class="scroll-animate-up">This project was successfully deployed at <b>PAMUNUWILA HARDWARE (Pvt) Ltd</b> and has been
    actively used to manage their daily business operations. In addition to serving a real client, it was also submitted
    and presented as <b>my final project for the first year of my university studies.</b> This dual-purpose project provided
    valuable real-world experience in understanding client needs, delivering production-ready software, and ensuring
    customer satisfaction. It significantly strengthened my practical development skills and my ability to independently
    deliver a full-scale commercial application—bridging the gap between academic knowledge and professional-level
    software engineering.</p>
