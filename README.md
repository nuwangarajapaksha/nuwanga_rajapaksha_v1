## Notes

- Logging is handled with `concurrent-log-handler` to support robust and concurrent-safe log file rotation.  
- The architecture is modular, making it easy to extend the project with blogs, contact forms, or other features.  
- For deployment on different operating systems or production, consider additional setup such as environment variables, database setup, and static files collection.
