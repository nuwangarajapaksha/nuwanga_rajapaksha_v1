                    Photography has always been one of my <b>innate talents</b>—something that came naturally to me from
                    a very
                    young age. My journey <b>began in childhood,</b> not with expensive cameras or formal training, but
                    with a
                    simple <b>mobile phone.</b> I was fascinated by the ability to freeze a moment in time, to tell
                    stories
                    through visuals, and to see the world through a different lens. Even as a child, I found myself
                    drawn to the small details—the way light fell across a surface, the symmetry in nature, or the
                    emotions captured in a candid smile.

                    My passion for photography began to take a more defined shape during my school years at Nalanda
                    College, where I was <b>deeply inspired by</b> the <b><a

                    Photographic Art Society. The work</a></b>
                    produced by the members, as well as the creative atmosphere they fostered, gave me a sense of
                    direction. It opened my eyes to the artistic side of photography and helped me understand that it
                    was more than just clicking a button—it was about composition, emotion, timing, and storytelling.

                <p class="scroll-animate-up">
                    Beyond school, I found <b>further inspiration</b> from both <b>local and international photographers
                    on social
                    media platforms.</b> I would spend hours studying their work, learning different techniques,
                    experimenting with styles, and absorbing knowledge from various online communities. Their creativity
                    pushed me to keep improving and evolving as a photographer.

                    My journey in photography <b>began during my Advanced Level (A/L) school years</b>—a time when I was
                    still
                    discovering my creative voice. What started as a humble passion quickly transformed into a lifelong
                    commitment to capturing the world through my lens. I <b>began with simple birthday shoots and
                    small-scale events organized by schools, community centers, and various institutions.</b> These
                    early
                    experiences helped me <b>develop a strong foundation in working with people, understanding lighting
                    in
                    diverse environments, and cultivating an intuitive eye for detail.</b>
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-animate-up">
                    As I gained confidence and technical skills, I gradually advanced to more professional-level
                    photography, including high-end <b>birthday shoots, private parties, corporate events, and fashion
                    modeling portfolios.</b> Working with clients from different walks of life allowed me to refine my
                    artistic vision while maintaining a strong focus on client satisfaction and storytelling through
                    images.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-animate-up">
                    In parallel to my client work, I also cultivated a deep personal passion for artistic and
                    exploratory photography. I ventured into <b>wildlife, landscape, and street photography, which
                    allowed
                    me to experience the world from new perspectives.</b> Whether it was the raw intensity of animals in
                    their natural habitat, the serene beauty of untouched landscapes, or the candid moments found in the
                    chaos of urban life, each genre taught me something unique about patience, timing, and emotion.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-animate-up">
                    Recognizing the importance of building an audience and sharing my work with the world, I established
                    a presence across multiple social media platforms. My <b>photography and videography content are
                    consistently showcased on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok,</b> where I not only display
                    finished work but also share behind-the-scenes footage, editing techniques, and creative processes.
                    These platforms have enabled me to connect with a wide audience, collaborate with fellow creatives,
                    and stay updated with global trends in photography and content creation.

                In conclusion, <b>my journey in photography has been a deeply personal and continually evolving
                experience—rooted in early passion, shaped by formal education, and refined through real-world practice.</b>
                From capturing simple moments with a mobile phone to producing professional-level work across diverse
                genres, photography has become more than just a creative outlet—it’s a way of life. With a strong
                foundation in both the technical and artistic aspects of the craft, a growing digital presence, and a
                commitment to lifelong learning, I am excited to keep exploring new horizons, telling meaningful stories
                through my lens, and inspiring others along the way.
